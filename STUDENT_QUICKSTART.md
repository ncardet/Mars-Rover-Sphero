# Mars Rover Rescue - Student Quick Start

## Your Mission

Mark Watney is stranded on Mars. NASA discovered he's alive, and YOU are a rover engineer who will help save him by programming autonomous supply rovers!

## How to Play

1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Navigate to the game folder
3. Type: `python3 mars_rover_rpg.py` and press Enter
4. Follow the story and make choices!

## Controls

- Read the story text carefully
- When you see options like `[1] [2] [3]`, type the number of your choice
- Press ENTER after typing your choice
- Press ENTER to continue when prompted

## The Three Missions

### Mission 1: Hab Perimeter Survey
**Your Goal:** Program the rover to travel in a hexagon around the Hab
**Skills:** Sequences (order of commands) and Loops (repeating)
**Key Math:** A hexagon has 6 sides and needs 60° turns

### Mission 2: Pathfinder Retrieval
**Your Goal:** Navigate 6-8 feet to recover the Pathfinder probe
**Skills:** Conditionals (IF/THEN decisions)
**Challenge:** Avoid obstacles and manage rover power

### Mission 3: Schiaparelli Supply Run
**Your Goal:** Deliver supplies to Schiaparelli Crater
**Skills:** Everything combined + Debugging (finding code errors)
**Challenge:** Complete autonomous navigation

## Coding Concepts You'll Learn

| Concept | What It Means | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Sequence** | Commands run in order | FORWARD, TURN, FORWARD |
| **Loop** | Repeat commands | REPEAT 6: [FORWARD, TURN] |
| **Conditional** | Make decisions | IF obstacle THEN turn |
| **Debugging** | Find and fix errors | Why did my square become a triangle? |

## Tips for Success

1. **Read carefully** - The story gives you clues
2. **Think about shapes** - For hexagons: 360° ÷ 6 = 60° per turn
3. **Consider order** - Code runs top to bottom, just like reading
4. **Don't rush** - Wrong answers teach you too!

## Connecting to Your Sphero

Everything in this game applies to your real Sphero robot:
- The hexagon path in Mission 1 = Your Hab Perimeter Survey
- The obstacles in Mission 2 = Your classroom Mars terrain
- The full journey in Mission 3 = Your Schiaparelli Challenge

## Game Stats

Watch your stats as you play:
- **Coding Skill:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (increases with correct answers)
- **Rover Power:** Keep it above 0%!
- **Missions Completed:** 0/3 → 3/3

## Stuck?

- Reread the question
- Think about what you learned in class
- Remember: wrong answers still teach you!
- You can replay missions to improve your score
